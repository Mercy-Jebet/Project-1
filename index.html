   <h1>Chapter 1</h1> 
   <p style = "font-family: papyrus; color:#0b7f97">THERE IS ONE mirror in my house. It is behind a sliding panel in the hallway upstairs. Our faction allows me to stand in front of it on the second day of every third month, the day my mother cuts my hair.</p>
   <p style = "font-family: papyrus; color:#0b7f97">I sit on the stool and my mother stands behind me with the scissors, trimming.<br> The strands fall on the floor in a dull, blond ring. When she finishes, she pulls my hair away from my face and twists it into a knot. I note how calm she looks and how focused she is. She is well-practiced in the art of losing herself. I can’t say the same of myself.

    I sneak a look at my reflection when she isn’t paying attention—not for the sake of vanity, but out of curiosity. A lot can happen to a person’s appearance in three months. In my reflection, I see a narrow face, wide, round eyes, and a long, thin nose—I still look like a little girl, though sometime in the last few months I turned sixteen. The other factions celebrate birthdays, but we don’t. It would be self-indulgent.
    
    “There,” she says when she pins the knot in place. Her eyes catch mine in the mirror. It is too late to look away, but instead of scolding me, she smiles at our reflection.</p>
    <h3><i>Chapter two</i> </h3>
    <p style = "font-family: papyrus; color:#0b7f97">I frown a little. Why doesn’t she reprimand me for staring at myself?

        “So today is the day,” she says.
        
        “Yes,” I reply.
        
        “Are you nervous?”
        
        I stare into my own eyes for a moment. Today is the day of the aptitude test that will show me which of the five factions I belong in. And tomorrow, at the Choosing Ceremony, I will decide on a faction; I will decide the rest of my life; I will decide to stay with my family or abandon them.
        
        “No,” I say. “The tests don’t have to change our choices.”
        
        “Right.” She smiles. “Let’s go eat breakfast.”
        
        “Thank you. For cutting my hair.”
        
        She kisses my cheek and slides the panel over the mirror. I think my mother could be beautiful, in a different world. Her body is thin beneath the gray robe. She has high cheekbones and long eyelashes, and when she lets her hair down at night, it hangs in waves over her shoulders. But she must hide that beauty in Abnegation.</p>

<h2 title="Hello HTML!"><u><i>Chapter three</i></u></h2>
<p style = "font-family: papyrus; color:#0b7f97">Sometimes in big Hollywood movies they’ll have
    these crazy chase scenes where somebody jumps or
    gets thrown from a moving car. The person hits the
    ground and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop
    and pop up and dust themselves off, like it was no
    big deal. Whenever I see that I think, That’s rubbish.
    Getting thrown out of a moving car hurts way
    worse than that.
    I was nine years old when my mother threw me
    out of a moving car. It happened on a Sunday. I
    know it was on a Sunday because we were coming
    home from church, and every Sunday in my
    childhood meant church. We never missed church.
    My mother was—and still is—a deeply religious
    woman. Very Christian. Like indigenous peoples
    around the world, black South Africans adopted the
    religion of our colonizers. By “adopt” I mean it was
    forced on us. The white man was quite stern with the
    native. “You need to pray to Jesus,
    ” he said. “Jesus
    will save you.” To which the native replied,
    “Well, we
    do need to be saved—saved from you, but that’s
    beside the point. So let’s give this Jesus thing a shot.”
