<p style = "font-family: papyrus; color:#0b7f97">Sometimes in big Hollywood movies they’ll have
    these crazy chase scenes where somebody jumps or
    gets thrown from a moving car. The person hits the
    ground and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop
    and pop up and dust themselves off, like it was no
    big deal. Whenever I see that I think, That’s rubbish.
    Getting thrown out of a moving car hurts way
    worse than that.
    I was nine years old when my mother threw me
    out of a moving car. It happened on a Sunday. I
    know it was on a Sunday because we were coming
    home from church, and every Sunday in my
    childhood meant church. We never missed church.
    My mother was—and still is—a deeply religious
    woman. Very Christian. Like indigenous peoples
    around the world, black South Africans adopted the
    religion of our colonizers. By “adopt” I mean it was
    forced on us. The white man was quite stern with the
    native. “You need to pray to Jesus,
    ” he said. “Jesus
    will save you.” To which the native replied,
    “Well, we
    do need to be saved—saved from you, but that’s
    beside the point. So let’s give this Jesus thing a shot.”
